Our proposed system is a cryptocurrency exchange system. We will support a few different cryptocoins like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, etc. Each user has a wallet for each cryptocoin type. Users can login, view their wallets, exchange between different types of coins, send and receive coins and put buy/sell offers. For simplicity, our proposed system will not be connected to the real world cryptocoin exchanges, so we will maintain our own database, but our cryptocoin prices will come from the real exchange servers over internet, so our cryptocoins will have the real world prices in real time.
